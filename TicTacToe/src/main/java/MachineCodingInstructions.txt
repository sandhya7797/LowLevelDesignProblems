    steps :-
    1. create new project in your IDE and create project structure on high-level (models, controllers, services, repositories packages etc)
    2. create all model classes inside model package for all the entities present in the requirements.
    3. Add all attributes for their respective model class and add getters and setters as required.
    4. maintain separate packages for design patterns (at-least for interfaces) if possible include implementations also.
    5. create a manager class (like Game class) where all entities are being managed.
    6. Implement builder design pattern on the Game Class (which includes input validations also).
    7. create a controller class (like GameController) and expose APIs/methods/functionalities used by the game to the outside world or client. Functionalities should be specific to the controller.
    8. Add constructors in all model classes carefully. (If constructors are not created properly we might get NullPointerExceptions).
    9. Implement all functionalities of game in controller class.

Scope of Improvements -
1. At game start ask if undo should be enabled ?
2.
